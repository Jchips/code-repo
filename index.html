            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p id="bio"> My name is Kiengchay Gomez. I am a new <em>older</em> mom and a kid at ❤️. My son's middle 
                name comes from a popular video game. I <em>can't wait</em> until he's at the age where he wants to play so I
                can <em>use</em> him as an excuse to play, too.</p>
            <p id="education">I currently have a Bachelor of Business Administration in Information Systems.</p>
            <p id="experience">My job experience includes everything under the ☀️; food, retail, data-entry, non-profit, project management, 
                and even stuffing packets for banks. In recent years I have worked mainly in the Logistics sector, and when I have time I help my husband with his 
                side-hustle as an e-commerce reseller. I share with him insights about how transportation works, and translating their lingo so he can understand 
                his vendors a bit better.</p>
            <p id="goals">My immediate goals are to build a solid foundation in software development and master at least one programming language by 
               end of 2024. The goal after that is to land a good-paying job in tech so my husband and I can move back to a big city, buy a decent size house, 
               give our son more opportunities, and live relatively comfortable into our retirement years.</p>
