            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p id="bio"> My name is Kiengchay Gomez. I am a new <em>older</em> mom and a kid at ❤️. My son's middle 
                name comes from a popular video game. I <em>can't wait</em> until he's at the age where he wants to play so I
                can <em>use</em> him as an excuse to play, too.</p>
            <p id="education">I have a Bachelor of Business Administration in Information Systems and an Associate of Science with a Field of Study
                in Business.</p>
            <p id="experience">My job experience includes everything under the ☀️; food, retail, data-entry, non-profit, project management, 
                and even packet stuffing for banks. In recent years it has been mainly in the sector of Logistics or Transportation and when I can,
                I help my husband with his side-hustle.</p>
            <p>My immediate goal is to build a solid foundation in software development and master at least one language by the end of 401. 
                A more long term goal is to land a good-paying job in tech so my husband and I can move back to a big city, buy a decent size house,
                give our son more opportunities than we had, and live relatively comfortable during our retirement years.</p>
